# Data-Mining-Project


In this project we explore the human rights situation all over the world. We used tabular data from world countries development. The data contains numerical indices for many types of indicators like :
•	Human Development Index (HDI)
•	Gender Inequality Index (GII)
•	Unemployment Rate
•	Inequality in Education 
•	And a lot more
We will show the difference between democracies countries and dictatorships countries. 
In addition, we explore the Amnesty International Reports since 2017. Each document contains textual data on human rights in mostly all the countries in the world, each document is around 400 pages. We use sentiment analysis to check distributions over the years and find the worst and best sentiment countries. We use word embeddings to cluster the countries into groups and explore the results in many ways like visualization of geographical data, graph analysis and more.
